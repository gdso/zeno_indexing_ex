# zeno_indexing_ex

Yet another fractional indexing library: 

 * based on (but not necessarily compatible) with the 
algorithm introduced by David Greenspan.

 * with a unique (and ironic) name (see Zeno's [dichotomy paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Dichotomy_paradox)),
 meant to dispel the idea that it's byte-for-byte compatible with other implementations of Greenspan's algorithm

 * is published alongside a compatible Javascript library (TODO)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `zenos_indexing_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:zenos_indexing_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
